CHECK OUT DEVELOP BRANCH FOR MOST RECENT CHANGES / COMMITS

Summary: Fun little prototype for an Idle Game, looking to transfer into either  a discord server or unity game once finished up :)

Not worrying much about layout of game - since its just a fun prototype, as long as all info is there to debug.

TO DO

- Weapon/Armour need to inherit from a generic Item class 	(Although their function is widely going to differ)

- Player needs default equiptment to be shown on screen, stickman block layout
 
- Menu to swap out players equiptment

- Weapons need a sell price, quick sell if invent is full

- Look into windows notifications - sent user an alert if an item was found while program is running (For certain rarities)

- Shop that changes every 5 mins or so (Gold sink)

- Some kind of lucky draw (?) to add later though
